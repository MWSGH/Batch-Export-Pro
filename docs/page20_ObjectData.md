# Object Data

**Object Data is a set of modules that handle properties assigned per Object.**  


Each Object has it's own Object Data properties such as Export Name, Offset Location and (soon) Color Palette.  
They allow to handle each object in export operations consistently.  

They share common functionallity like "Assign to selected" that assigns the same Object Data value to all Objects in scene selection.
