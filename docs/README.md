# Batch Export Pro
### Blender extension addon
Batch Export Pro is a set of tools encapsulated into a simple well organized N-panel aimed to improve workflows of using Blender in conjunction with external softwares like Adobe Substance 3D Suite and Unreal Engine 5.  
Created based on my personal and professional experience, knowledge and needs.  

You can read about the features and purchase a copy on the [Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/batch-export-pro).

Batch Export Pro n-panel is available only in Blender Object Mode.  
You have to select Objects before exporting. Exporting of a whole scene is not available.  


## Requirements  
| Batch Export Pro | Blender |
|:-----|:---:|
| 1.0.0 | 4.2.0 or later |

## Installing
The easiest way to install Batch Export Pro is to do so directly within Blender. You can do this by going to Edit > Preferences > Get Extensions > Install from Disk. This will open a File Browser in Blender, allowing to you navigate to and select the zip file you downloaded. Press Install zip file.

If your browser auto-extracted the downloaded zip file, then you will need to re-compress the Batch Export Pro folder before installing, or use Save As to save the zip file without extracting the contents.

Once installed, Blender should automatically enable Batch Export Pro. If that is not the case you can search in Add-ons and enable the add-on by clicking the checkbox next to Batch Export Pro.

### If you have any issues with installing, please try the following steps:

1. Download the latest version of Batch Export Pro for your version of Blender (see Requirements section above).
2. Open Blender
3. Head to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons and search for Batch Export Pro
4. Expand by clicking the triangle, and then press Remove
5. Close Blender to completely clear out the previous version
6. Open Blender and head to preferences again
7. Click Install
8. Navigate to your Batch Export Pro zip file (please do not unzip)
9. Click Install Add-on
10. Enable Batch Export Pro
